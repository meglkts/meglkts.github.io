    <H3>What is Abstract Sequential Thinking?</H3>
    <p>
      After taking the <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html">Gregorc Thinking Style Quiz</a> I identified my thinking style as Abstract Sequential.  At first, this surprised me, since I thought I might be even more linear of a thinker and identify with Concrete Sequential.  However, after reading more about the type of thinker and learner described as abstract and sequential, I certainly agree.  In his description of the <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm">Mind Styles</a>, a major difference between concrete and abstract thinkers is that I tend to look for meaning behind what is visible and tend communicate more implicitly than explicitly.  An A.S. thinker also is known to analyze before making decisions, which is me to a fault.  Other idetifiers are applying logic in solving problems.  I can see these qualities play out in my work so far in learning code.  I don't like to just into challenges or exericises until I thoroughly understood the directions and had some time to at least think through my plan of attack.  I don't generally jump in and just try something unless it seems fairly easy or intuitive.

      A second aspect of an A.S. thinker is the manner in which he or she learns.  I found this description particularly interesting as I compared it to my own experiences.  The first learning quality given by Dr. Gregorc was that A.S. learners like to have access to experts and resources.  I always thought this was some unique need I had, not necessarily one aligned to anyone who shares my thinking style.  This has been true my whole life, and remains so in this new experience at Dev Bootcamp.  I tend to be drawn to cohort mates who I perceive as knowledgeable.  I will seek out these people as resources to whom I can ask questions and brainstorm ideas.  I can also see how this has made my experience more difficult at times.  I like having access to an instructor, but have not fully taken advantage of tutoring or office hours to ask some of my questions.  In some ways this has been good because it has helped me find other resources or experiment a little more; on the other hand, I would like to take better advantage of resources that are provided (and technically I am paying for :) ).  The last learning condition listed is to be able to work alone.  I definitely agree with this; however, I think I have learned throughout my education and professional life to adapt to both learning independently and collaboratively.  Since I like being able to ask questions, this is a positive of working with others.  Although I generally prefer to tackle intellectual problems alone because I like to have a chance to think without explaining initally, I have found the pairing experience really positive so far.  I am surprised, actually, but I think I have really benefited from this aspect more than I would have expected.

      What I found more difficult to connect with was the list of situations that A.S. thinkers find difficult.  I did not necessarily identify with all of these, or perhaps I don't think that I do.  Many of these related to difficulty interacting with those with opposing views and expressing emotion.  I like to think I am better at interacting with people, and a variety of them, than most A.S. thinkers are made out to be.  Obviously these qualities fall on a spectrum anyways, but I could easily identify with the other qualities.  I will have to look out for these in the coming weeks and be self aware in case I am exhibiting some of these difficulties more than I realize.

      After analyzing my thinking style and some of the qualitites that accompany it, I definitely want to continue to work on using more of my resources.  One of my learning difficulties I did agree with was not having enough time to fully reseach and learn a subject.  I feel this has been a struggle for me so far with balancing a job as well as the bootcamp.  I would really like to continue to work on my time management and prioritizing so I can go deeper into certain topics and solidify my understanding on others.  I will want to be efficient for my own sake so that I can spend more time in certain areas.  I think this will help me to feel overall more satisfied with the experience and my learning.

      As far as expanding my learning and operating with a growth mindset, there are a couple of areas I can identify now as being good places to begin.  I want to work on my experimentation.  Learning coding lends itself to trying new things and testing out ideas.  I want to use this as a springboard to develop this side of my learning and thinking.  I already do this to a certain extent, but can develop it more.  Lastly, I want to continue to exercise my group work skills, collaboration, and interpersonal communication.  I don't necessarily see these areas as being difficulties currently, but I think I just want to be aware of their importance and continue to build these areas.  I also want to use the feedback I receive and be a person that others want to work with, whether they are more advanced than me or less advanced and whether they are more introverted or extroverted.  I want to be someone whom others feel comfortable working with regardless of how we compare as professionals, intellectuals, or people.
