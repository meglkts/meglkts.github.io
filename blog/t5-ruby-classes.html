  <h2>My Class:  Right Triangles</h2>
  <h4 id="Date">June 22, 2015</h4>

  <section id="blogpost">
    <p>
      Classes are a major part of becoming proficient at Ruby and also creating practical applications of Ruby code.  I am still building my own knowledge of the concept, but here is an basic introduction and example to creating a class and using instance variables.
    </p>
    <p>
      The class I created is called Right_triangle.  It provides various methods that can be applied to a triangle to test for certain properties.
      <summary><code>
      class Right_Triangle

  def initialize(x, y, z)
    @sides = Array[x, y, z]
    @sides.sort
    @a = @sides[0]
    @b = @sides[1]
    @c = @sides[2]
  end

  def right_triangle?
    if @a**2 + @b**2 == @c**2
      puts "This is a right triangle because #{@a.to_s}^2 + #{@b.to_s}^2 = #{@c.to_s}^2."
    else
      puts "This is not a right triangle because #{@a.to_s}^2 + #{@b.to_s}^2 does not equal #{@c.to_s}^2."
    end
  end
end</code></summary>
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a very basic class.  The instance variables are defined and initalized in the first method.  I allowed a user to input any 3 integers in any order.  Then in the #intialize method, I reordered them from least to greatest to make the other methods funciton more easily.  You might also consider adding an argument error if the values provided are not numbers.  I originally had an argument error if the 3 sides did not form a right triangle, but instead chose to create a method to assess just that.  That takes us to the class method #right_triangle? that is used to assess whether the three provided side lengths do indeed form a right triangle.  
    </p>
    <p>
      We could add additonal relevant methods to our topic.  Classes are great for provided a variety of methods for a specific topic or assigning a variety of attributes to a subject.  Let's include a couple more methods that might fit into our Right_triangle class that uses the instance variables @a, @b, and @c to represent the sides lengths in ascending order.
    </p>
    <p>
      <summary><code>class Right_Triangle

  def initialize(x, y, z)
    @sides = Array[x, y, z]
    @sides.sort
    @a = @sides[0]
    @b = @sides[1]
    @c = @sides[2]
  end

  def right_triangle?
    if @a**2 + @b**2 == @c**2
      puts "This is a right triangle because #{@a.to_s}^2 + #{@b.to_s}^2 = #{@c.to_s}^2."
    else
      puts "This is not a right triangle because #{@a.to_s}^2 + #{@b.to_s}^2 does not equal #{@c.to_s}^2."
    end
  end

  def state_hypotenuse
    puts "The hypotenuse of this right triangle is #{@c.to_s} units."
  end

  def find_area
    area = @a * @b / 2.0
    puts "The area of this right triangle is #{area.to_s} units."
  end
 
end

triangle = Right_Triangle.new(3, 4, 5)
triangle.right_triangle?
triangle.state_hypotenuse
triangle.find_area</code><summary>
    </p>
    <p>
      Now our class also contains methods that identify the hypotenuse and can calculate the area.  Below our class, we are creating a new object triangle with sides 3, 4, and 5.  The outcome of running our methods on the object triangle will be the following:
    </p>
    <p>
      <summary><code>This is a right triangle because 3^2 + 4^2 = 5^2.
The hypotenuse of this right triangle is 5 units.
The area of this right triangle is 6.0 units.</code></summary>
