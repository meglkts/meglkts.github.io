      The infamous paired programming.  One of the aspects I was most nervous about coming to coding bootcamp.  Not because I don't like or can't work with others, but mostly because I was nervous and self-conscious of my skill level as I had no background experience.  Also, I came in to coding expecting this to be something I could be pretty good at given my past skill sets and strengths, so I feared that reality would not meet my expectations.  I will still say that I am a bit timid; however, I have truly enjoyed the pairing process thus far.  I have certainly had pairs that went better than others, but overall, it has been a positive and beneficial experience.  On the technical side, I have gained from seeing how others approach problems, seeing what types of methods I should be familiar with, better learning syntax, and using specific items like loops.  Without a formal instructor, I have benefited from being able to ask questions of my pairs, and often this can be a less threatening environment to be vulnerable.  It is very positive to end a paired challenge feeling accomplished and also feeling like each person brought something social, something creative, and something technical to the experience.  I think the assertiveness by the bootcamp regarding culture, teamwork, and rigid policies has caused people to be more patient with each other, more helpful, and more united than they would have otherwise been if we all would have jumped in with our preconceived notions about this experience.

      I have certainly had more positive experiences than not through the paired programming; however, there are some situations that have been challenging.  And I will say it's been more cultural than technical.  I have had pairing sessions where I felt far less skilled than my pair, which was very difficult for me.  I get very anxious in these situations if I feel speechless in the process.  I don't mind struggling by myself because I will do research, experiment, etc. but I feel far more comfortable doing these things solo.  This is an area I need to improve.  Establishing an evironment where questions are encouraged is very important.  If the culture on the team is very open and positive, the skill gap will not affect the experience.  Communication has been another large factor in the success of a pairing session.  Explaining one's thought process, asking questions openly, and explicitly saying when one needs to take a minute to think or research have been a part of my pairings with good communication.

      The second large part of pairing has been giving and receiving feedback. Similar to my anxieties about pairing in the first place, I am nervous to read feedback that implies that I am not smart, capable, or unpleasant in some way.  I like to think I am fairly socially intelligent, so I would not expect someone to have an awful experience as my pair, but we all want more than that.  I want 100% in the inspiring category or the category that states my partner benefited from my technically.  That is my goal.  Overall taking the feedback has been positive.  I certainly want actionable things to work on.  From what I have received so far, I need to address what I already know, which is to be more assertive and confident.  And if not, find a better way to handle a lack of knowledge in a particular pairing.  I was encouraged to read some feedback that said I should keep asking questions or ask more.  I really depend on being able to ask questions as a part of my learning.  As in any area I care about in my life, I want to continue to move from okay to good and good to great.

      Writing feedback that is kind and specific has not been difficult to me.  I like building people up but also only in ways that are genuine and true.  I have struggled to give constructive feedback at times for various reasons.  In my really positive pairings, I honestly don't have readily available constructive feedback.  I include what the person should keep doing, which I like to think is equally constructive as what to stop.  I like to have specific actions I can take, so I want to work to provide that for others, too.  For the more challenging pairing sessions, I think finding both a kind but helpful way to give constructive feedback is difficult.  I am confident that what I write is positive, but I don't know how it will be interpreted by the other person.  Also, given how few pairings we have done so far, I don't think they are very anonymous.  I am quite confident that I know each person who gave me each piece of feedback.  I am okay with receiving the less anonymous feedback, but I don't want my pair to misinterpret what I am saying to them.  I actually think maybe a quick conversation of high-low-high at the end of a pair might be better than reading it.  It would give people a chance to ask questions about their feedback, ask for more specific feedback if needed, and people would be kind.
