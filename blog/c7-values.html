      The values I chose include the following, in no particular order:
      <ul>close relationships</ul>
      <ul>challenge</ul>
      <ul>helping society</ul>
      <ul>accountability (or reliability)</ul>
      <ul>introspection</ul>
      <ul>competition</ul>
      <ul>confidence</ul>
      <ul>personal development</ul>
      <ul>meaningful work</ul>
      <ul>faith</ul>
      <ul>intellectual status</ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      I try to live up to all of these values because they are my values.  I am certainly more and less successful at following through on these at various points in life, but they remain my values.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will elaborate on "personal development" as one of my values.  I think this actually encompasses the rest of the values.  At one point on staff at the high school I worked at, we took time to think about our personal missions.  A large part of my mission is to be ever-improving.  To live with purpose and have pride in what I do.  I see this in personal development as I want to never settle but always work to improve as a person, which includes as a family member, a friend, an employee, a citizen, a human, and a person of faith.  
    </p>
    <p>
      The most frequent advice I have given has been to my girls at the school where I worked.  We have an advisory program where teachers are assigned a group of same-sex students to help mentor in life and school.  By the end of year three, they solicited my advice pretty frequently.  I would say this relates to personal development, challenge, meaningful work, and close relationships.  If their questions related to school, I would always push them to challenge themselves for personal growth and know that their hard work would pay off in the future and that it mattered.  If it was more personal, then it may have been related to maintaining and navigating important relationships with family or friends.  I would probably give advice that supports what I find valuable in life.
    </p>
    <p>
      I feel proud when I think about my values.  I like my values.  Obviously I feel most proud when I am living them well.  I don't know if I see how my values will help address my sensing of stereotype threat.  I can see how stereotype threat could stifle one's realization of their values, so that is extra motivation to be self-aware.  Perhaps introspection, confidence, and some others could relate.  As far as other struggles I might encounter while working at DBC, I think it will be most important for me to establish good relationships with people in my cohort, to take time for myself and to keep being introspective, and to continue to remember the satisfaction that comes with facing a challenging, persisting, and finding success.
