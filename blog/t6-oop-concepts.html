      Upon being assigned a few OOP topics to choose from, I selected to research and write about instance vs. class methods.  My understanding of classes as a concept in general is something I want to better solidify.  I learn best through doing research, seeing examples, and then applying the concepts in creative practice.  In a recent session with a guide, she demonstrated creating a class method using <code>self</code> within the class.  This did not click for me initially, so I spent some time researching self and exploring how this relates to instance vs. class methods.   
    </p>
    <p>
      Class methods are those that can be called on the original created class.  Instance methods; however, can only be called on new instances of that created class.  I found basic examples like the one below to be helpful in the introduction of this idea.
    </p>
    <pre>
        class Name
          def initialize(name)
            @name = name
          end

          def introduce
            puts "My name is #{@name}."
          end
        end
      </pre>
    <p>
    Within the class <code>Name</code>, an instance method <code>introduce</code> was created.  We can call the method <code>introduce</code> on any instance of the class <code>Name</code>.  I cannot; however, call the method <code>introduce</code> on the class itself.  
    <pre>
      dan = Name.new("Dan")
      dan.introduce           # My name is Dan.
    </pre>
    <p>
      However if we try to call the following, we will get an error.
    </p>
    <pre>
      Name.introduce          #undefined method 'introduce' for Name:Class
    </pre>
    <p>
      We can define a class method as well.
    </p>
    <pre>
      class Name
          def self.class_method
            puts "I am calling a class method now."
          end

          def initialize(name)
            @name = name
          end

          def introduce
            puts "My name is #{@name}."
          end
        end
    </pre>
    <p>
      We can then call the class method.
    </p>
    <pre>
      Name.class_method       # I am calling a class method now.

      dan.class_method        # undefined method 'class_method' for (instance of Name class)  
    </pre>
    <p>
      Below is a class I created to experiment with my understanding of instance verses class variables that imitated my recent assignment.
    </p>
    <pre>
      ROSTER = {:Audrey=> {position: "setter", jersey: 1}, :Juana => {position: "libero", jersey: 21}, :Rut => {position: "defense", jersey: 3}}

      class VolleyballPlayer
        
        def self.introduce_team
          puts "This is a class method"
          ROSTER.each do |player, info|
            puts "Number #{ROSTER[player][:jersey]} is #{player} playing #{ROSTER[player][:position]}"
          end
        end

        def initialize(player, position, jersey)
          @player = player
          @position = position
          @jersey = jersey
        end

        def introduce_player
          puts "This is an instance of the class VolleyballPlayer"
          puts "Number #{@jersey.to_s} is #{@player} playing #{@position.to_s}."
        end
      end


      audrey = VolleyballPlayer.new("Audrey", ROSTER[:Audrey][:position], ROSTER[:Audrey][:jersey])
      audrey.introduce_player

      rut = VolleyballPlayer.new("Rut", ROSTER[:Rut][:position], ROSTER[:Rut][:jersey])
      rut.introduce_player

      juana = VolleyballPlayer.new("Juana", ROSTER[:Juana][:position], ROSTER[:Juana][:jersey])
      juana.introduce_player

      VolleyballPlayer.introduce_team
    </pre>
    <p>This would result in the following pritning to the console:</p>
    <pre>
      This is an instance of the class VolleyballPlayer
      Number 1 is Audrey playing setter.
      This is an instance of the class VolleyballPlayer
      Number 3 is Rut playing defense.
      This is an instance of the class VolleyballPlayer
      Number 21 is Juana playing libero.
      This is a class method
      Number 1 is Audrey playing setter
      Number 21 is Juana playing libero
      Number 3 is Rut playing defense
    </pre>
    <p>
      Instance methods are the best option for creating single instances of a class.  Like one version of a player introduction, in my case.  In the case of wanting to create a series of instances or a data table, for example, you might consider creating a class method that generates a group of instances.
