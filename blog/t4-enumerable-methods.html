  <h1>Post #4: Enumerable#cycle</h1>
  <h2>How does it work?</h2>

      Cycle is another aptly named method in Ruby.  When <code>#cycle</code> is called on an array, the method cycles through each element infinitely unless a break is called or an argument is used.
    </p>
    <p>For example,</p>
      <pre>
        array = ["mama", "papa", "baby"]
        array.cycle 
        #=> mama, papa, baby, mama, papa, baby, mama, papa, baby, mama, papa, baby, mama, papa, baby, mama...
        <p>Whereas,</p> 
        array.cycle(2)
        #=> mama, papa, baby, mama, papa, baby
      </pre>
  
    <p>
      If you wish to print the cycle to the console, then you can use the block:
    </p>
      <pre>
        array.cycle(3) {|x| puts x}
      </pre>

    <p>
      The cycle could also be stopped at a specific point such as,
    </p>
      <pre>
        array.cycle do |x|
        break if x == "papa"
      </pre>
    <p>
      The <code>#cycle</code> method does not automatically store the values, so you could choose to make a new array and push the cycled values to the array.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hopefully you are starting to think of some situations where <code>#cycle</code> might be useful.  This might incude when are you looking to assign roles or positions to a group of people.  You could combine the <code>#zip</code> and the <code>#cycle</code> methods to create a distribution of responsiblities.  Unfortunately <code>#cycle</code> will only run a complete course.  It is not possible to stop at a certain number of elements except at the end of a full cycle.  I think this is probably the biggest limitation of the method, similar to <code>n.times do</code>.
