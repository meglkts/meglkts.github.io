  <h2>Envisioning the DBC Experience</h2>

      Throughout all of my interactions with DBC, be it staff, media, or curriculum it has been made crystal clear that this is a collaborate work environment.  As humans we learn a lot through social interaction, communicating about concepts, teaching others, and working collectively.  I can see that DBC promotes this type of work atmosphere, and not just on the surface but genuinely.  I also understand some of the why behind the mission as we think about our future careers and employment within a tech-based community.  When the message is communicated that how we work at DBC is as important as what we are working on, I believe it.

      Coming from a teaching background, I am fully on board with the idea that working as a team is the most effective way to accomplish a task and to learn, especially when it is difficult.  I have seen this as I prepare to teach my lessons.  I also know this to be true as I witnessed my students grappling with new concepts.  In fact, in my last year in the classroom, I pushed this type of learning more than any other year and have seen the benefits.  The idea that I am entering this with a cohort of people to learn with and from aligns with my beliefs about education and about being a productive team member.  I am eager to meet new people, to be able to ask a teammate for help rather than an instructor, to improve my skills as a collaborator, and to develop my confidence along with my code.  I am excited to become better at experimenting, problem solving, and learning with peers.

      Despite my full support of the core values of peer work and collaboration, I am nervous about starting the process.  I appreciated the acknowledgement of the "two fears" in Shereef's Fireside Chat.  I see myself aligning more with the first, having imposter's syndrome at times.  I do not have a lot of experience in coding, and I don't know how my pace will compare to others at thinking of ideas and executing those ideas.  I am not afraid of being able to do the work, but it is different having to learn "on stage."  I am used to being an independent learner and processing things in my own way and time, so I will have to adapt to some of the peer tasks.  I am most nervous about the peer pairing challenges for a couple of reasons.  One, I don't know how well I will do at first working together in seperate locations verses side by side.  Second, I feel very comfortable trying different ideas at my own speed, researching methods or syntax, and experimenting on my own; however, I feel like I might get stage fright when needing to work under a time limit and to explain my thinking out loud and in the moment.  I am open to learning and am always self-improving, but I am worry about other's impressions of me if I'm being honest.  I feel like I am pretty smart and logical and good at critical thinking, but this is a new experience.  I will work to be patient with myself.  I also want to make sure I am a good pair for someone who feels the same way.  Golden Rule mindset, I suppose.

      Overall I am excited to begin this new journey.  I am eager to work at a place that promotes values such as collaboration, diversity, lifelong learning, and reflection.  I can see myself thriving in this type of environment as long as I open myself up to being vulnerable at times, trusting the process, and receiving feedback.  I am already loving being a student again.
