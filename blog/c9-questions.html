      It can be a very satisifying to search through Stack Overlow and find exactly the question you wanted to ask posted by a fellow coder.  Unfortunately, this doesn't always happen and you need to post your own issue for consultation.  And we've all read quetions on our Google+ communities and alike that are not understandable or that require follow-up to be able to address.  So what is it exactly that makes a question a <i>good</i> question?  What is it that makes your question desirable to tackle and gives you the best chance of getting the answer you've been searching?
    </p>
    <p>
      Here are a few good rules for writing solid questions:
      <ol>
        <li>Golden Rule</li>
        <li>Write a good title/opener</li>
        <li>Describe the problem in the beginning</li>
        <li>Be concise and specific</li>
        <li>Use code when necessary and use it wisely</li>
        <li>Use good spelling/grammar</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <h5>Golden Rule</h5>
      <p>
        As Jon Skeet stated in his <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140709094611/http://msmvps.com/blogs/jon_skeet/archive/2010/08/29/writing-the-perfect-question.aspx">blog</a> on asking good coding questions, pose your question following the "Golden Rule:"  Would you want to answer your own question if you had the knowledge?  Is it clear or confusing?  Is the desired outcome apparent or unknown?
      </p>
    <h5>Write a good title/opener</h5>
      <p>
        Make sure you identify what langauge you are using.  Also be sure that the specific problem you are having is in the beginning of the post.  Oftentimes, people post a question that is actually a statement.  What is it you are looking for?
      </p>
    <h5>Describe the problem in the beginning</h5>
      <p>
        Include your desired outcomes and what actually is your current output.  This way someone who tries to run your code can see if they, too, are getting this output and have an aim as they try to help.  Be specific while not overwhelming your reader.  You can include some efforts you have already made or acknowledge the shortcomings in your solution.  This way your reader knows with what knowledge base to begin answering your question.
      </p>
    <h5>Be concise and specific</h5>
      <p>
        No one wants to read more information than they need or feel they don't have the time to tackle an issue where just reading the problem seems overly time-consuming.  Certainly include enough specific information to make it easy on your reader, but stick to the point.  Give enough detail.  Probably being too vague is worse than being too informative.
      </p>
    <h5>Use code when necessary and use it wisely</h5>
      <p>
        Not all questions require including your code, but sometimes this is necessary or helpful.  Include enough code that someone else can work with what you have.  Don't include superfluous code that is not necessary to address the issue.  Especially if your issue is regarding syntax, it would be helpful to see the code.  This also saves you from needing to be asked for your code in the beginning.  In some cases, it might be easy enough to just post a screenshot, but in other cases you might want a link or actual code block so that someone else can easily manipulate your work.  Consider what your question requires of a responder.
      </p>
    <h5>Use good spelling/grammar</h5>
    <p>
      You are always presenting yourself and you are always being perceived by others.  Use appropriate spelling and grammar.  Don't unnecessarily abbreviate common words or avoid using capitalization.  Once you have generated your initial question with all required elements, re-read your draft before posting.  You want to seem intelligent and your question worth investing time.
    </p>
    <h5>Final Thoughts</h5>
    <p>
      As the first rule stated, look at your overall question or post through the lens of the reader.  Would you want to answer your own question if you saw it?  Is it going to require several follow up quesitons to know what you are actually asking, what you are working with, or what is going on in your problem?  And when someone has attempted to reply to your query, make sure you respond.  Be active in your own quest.
