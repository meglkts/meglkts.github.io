		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<section id="about-me">
			<p>
				I am a Michigan-raised girl, Chicago urban math teacher turned web devloper, and soon-to-be San Diegan.  I love traveling, experiencing culture, and having new life adventures, especially in the company of my husband and favorite person, Dan.  I am a Tigers and Red Wings fan.  At my small liberal arts college outside Chicago, I played volleyball and have since taken up running for fitness.  I feel lucky to have hit adulthood in the wake of craft coffee, food, and, of course, beer.

				On a more serious note, I am passionate about educational equity.  I am fortunate to have studied teaching in one of the cities most in need of educational reform.  My experience teaching math in the city of Chicago has been one of the most influential times in my life.  I had the privilege of working with the most admirable teachers and inspiring students.  It is my hope that I can find a way to fuse my new technological skills with a mission for empowering unrepresented youth.

				In my five years as a high school teacher I had two personal realizations.  First was how much I love learning and being intellectually challenged.  I have found a lot of joy in taking on web developing as a new skill.  I love facing a practical challenge that requires logic, critical thinking, and problem solving to design a solution.  Second was who I work with is equally as important as what I am doing.  One of my favorite aspects of working in my school was the impressive people working around me.  I know that in my future career I again want to be able to admire the people with whom I work.  I want a positive enrivonment for collaboration and professional growth so that I can teach and learn with the people around me.
